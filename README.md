# Raspberry Etude
### By James Gray & Shen Tan, 2015

This repository contains the code for a generative electronic music piece entitled "Raspberry Etude," written by James Gray and produced in collaboration with Shen Tan for "Interhacktive: An Interactive Multimedia Expo," held at the University of Victoria in 2015. This piece is a never-ending ambient song that can be played using the Sonic Pi live coding music environment, and was performed using a Raspberry Pi and two speakers during the expo.
